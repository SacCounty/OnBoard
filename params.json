  "body": "### What Is OnBoard?\r\nAn extensible system to keep track of boards & commissions details, the people appointed to those groups, any legislation they write, and the voting records of each committee member. The City of Bloomington, IN uses this application to track information about our boards & commissions. To get a feel for this system, you can view our instance here: <https://bloomington.in.gov/onboard/committees>\r\n\r\n**OnBoard** is open source and released under the terms of the GNU Affero Public License.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nWe use the same configuration for our PHP applications. To make sure the documentation stays up to date, we maintain it separately. It is available online: <https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/blossom/wiki>\r\n\r\n###Additional Requirements\r\n\r\nThis application also uses LibreOffice to convert files to PDF. You will need to install the headless version of LibreOffice Writer. For Ubuntu systems this is\r\n\r\n    apt-get install libreoffice-common libreoffice-writer\r\n\r\n_Ensure Apache has permission to write into the SITE_HOME directory. With some older versions of LibreOffice,  Apache required ownership of that directory.___",
